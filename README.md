# eml_to_pdf

**DEV BRANCH**

Convert `.eml` (email) files to PDF using only Python, making them easier
to archive, share, and view without requiring an email client.

Based on various modest libraries but NOT on a full rendering engine like
WebKit or Gecko. [python-pdfkit](https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdf-kit)
and [wkhtmltopdf](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf) are
[deprecated libraries](
    https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit?tab=readme-ov-file#deprecation-warning)

Runs on all platforms that support the dependencies, incl. Microsoft Windows

This software is in beta state. There are some unit tests, I use it in my own
workflow, but we need some actual users/downloads, basics for translations and
boilerplate debian packaging files to proceed to a 1.0 release.

## Features

- Converts email body plain from HTML or plain text message body.
- Tries to filter potential security or privacy issues.
- Preserves formatting, character encodings, embedded images.
- Generates a header section with email metadata From, To, Subject, Date and, if
  any, a list of attachments with size and md5sum.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11+
- [weasyprint](https://weasyprint.org/) - a visual rendering engine for HTML
  and CSS that can export to PDF.
- [python-markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown) - for
  HTML'izing plain text.
- [hurry.filesize](https://pypi.org/project/hurry.filesize/) - return human
  readable filesizes.
- [beautifulsoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - HTML
  sanitization.

## Installation

Download the right executable for your platform from the [latest release](
  releases/latest) and run it in your shell.

or

use pip after downloading the source release package or cloning or downloading
this repo to install this package:

```bash
pip install .
```

Users of Arch linux or derived distro's like Manjora can use AUR package
[eml_to_pdf-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/eml_to_pdf-git).

Check [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for more detailed installation instructions if
you need more help.

## Usage

eml_to_pdf will convert all .eml files in an input directory and
save converted PDF files in the specified output directory.

The output filenames are formatted as:
`YYYY-MM-DD_subject[-counter].pdf`, where:

- The date prefix is taken from the email's sent date.
- The email subject is taken from the email headers.
- Should there be any duplicate filenames, then a counter will be added.
- The extension is changed to `.pdf`

For example, `some_file.eml` with subject "My Email" sent on March 15, 2024
will become `2024-03-15_My_Email.pdf`.

```text
usage: eml_to_pdf.py [-h] [-d] [-n number] [-p size] [-v] input_dir output_dir

Convert EML files to PDF

positional arguments:
  input_dir             Directory containing EML files
  output_dir            Directory for PDF output

options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -d, --debug_html      Write intermediate html file next to pdf's.
  -n number, --number-of-procs number
                        Number of parallel processes. Defaults to the number
                        of available logical CPU's to eml_to_pdf.
  -p size, --page size  a3 a4 a5 b4 b5 letter legal or ledger with or without
                        'landscape', for example: 'a4 landscape' or 'a3'
                        including quotes. Defaults to 'a4', implying portrait.
  --unsafe              Don't sanitize HTML from potentially unsafe elements
                        such as remote images, scripts, etc. This may expose
                        sensitive user information.
  -v, --verbose         Show a lot of verbose debugging info. Forces number
                        of procs to 1.
```

Example below renders all .eml files in `./emails` to a4 landscape oriented pdf's
in `./pdf`:

```bash
python eml-to-pdf.py -p 'a4 landscape' ./emails ./pdfs
```

### Page size

Not all emails are properly formatted. Part of your mail might not be visible
in the pdf in case an email doesn't limit width of some elements such as
images, tables or others. You can play with page sizes and orientations to try
and accomodate wide emails.

### Security

#### HTML Sanitization

Emails can contain HTML which can contain stuff you don't expect or want.

In the best case your emails contain clean HTML.

In common cases they will contain intentional tracking of end users using
forged remote sources for images and other resources. This is a common
practice in marketing or mass mailing solutions.

eml_to_pdf tries to keep the formatting in your mails Ã¡nd clean up
potentially malicious content using custom filtering of tags, remote images,
remote stylesheets, etc.

We try to cleanup. We can't give you a 100% guarantee. If you're very worried,
please cleanup your mails yourself.

#### MD5 sums of attachments

eml_to_pdf lists attachments with their md5sums. You can use these md5sums for
your convenience. They give a very strong indication that files are not
altered. They will not be usable as proof in courts of law.
They are not intended to be.

## Issues

We've tested eml_to_pdf with a couple of cases with embedded images, tables,
unicode or specific encodings. Refer to [tests](tree/main/tests) for example
emails.

Please open an issue ticket if you have a mail where conversion results are
not usable. Describe what you think your message contains and the output you
expect. Attach verbose eml_to_pdf output of only this eml file and attach
the eml file itself. We're not promising a solution, but we can
have a look.

**Please cleanup any attachments you add of things you don't want to share with
the world.**
